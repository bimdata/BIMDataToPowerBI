# Dashboard

This is the dashboard. It's a Power BI project that gathers all the data of elements from an IFC of the BIMData API.

## How-To

In this folder you can find two things : 

* `dashboard.pbix`
* `src/`

The `dashboard.pbix` file is the Power BI project. (It's possibly not up-to-date so follow below instructions to make your own dashboard)

The `src/` folder gathers all the Python scripts used by the `dashboard.pbix` file.
