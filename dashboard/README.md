# Dashboard

This is the dashboard. It's a Power BI project gathering all the element's data from an IFC we get using the BIMData API.

## How-To

In this folder you can find two things: 
* `dashboard.pbix`
* `src/`

The `dashboard.pbix` file is the Power BI project. (It may be not up-to-date, follow the instructions below to make your own dashboard).

The `src/` folder gathers all the Python scripts needed by the `dashboard.pbix` file.
